## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- Twitter
    - Ability to interact with anybody that has posted something
    - Simplicity of UI Design
- Instagram
    - Overall app simplicity
    - Story feature 
    - Picture editing feature
- Notion
    - Use of AI to build pages
    - clean UI design 
    - Ability to make folders through drop down menus

##My own app idea
- Diabetic medicine, tracker, reminder, store
- I would like to create an app that helps diabetic patients track their sensitive information, allow them to share that information to certified doctors on the app. It would also allow them to interact with other diabetic patients who might have the same issue. It will remind them to take certain medicine based on what they input and give a small store option to buy medicine approved by their doctor on the app


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Encountered a lot of challenges with implimenting the randomized pictures
- Could not center picture for a while but found a function to do so after further research
- Wasn't able to find the drop down menu within the storyboard that the description showed but realized it was an issue with my Xcode loading so I restarted it and it worked
